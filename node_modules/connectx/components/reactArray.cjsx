React = require 'react'

TODO: Test that this works?
The idea is that when you need to create an element that is essentially an array
render must return a single element. using <ReactArray></ReactArray> should wrap
all the elements of the array so they can be returned as one object declaritivly
and still without creating a dom element (for cases where the markup structure is
pre-determined by the CSS/existing requirements)

module.exports = React.createClass {render: -> {@props.children}}
